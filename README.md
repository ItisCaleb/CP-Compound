# CP Compound
This is the best IDE for Competitive Programmer(will be)

## About The Project and History
This project aims to create an IDE tailored for competitive programming participants, helping them achieve higher efficiency during training and competitions by providing useful competition-related tools. We took inspiration from projects like CP Editor but aimed to include more extensive and rich features.

Currently, the release version 1.0 includes basic file management, a checker, and essential code editing functionalities such as compiling, execution, and syntax highlighting. The standout feature of this version is the template library, which allows users to quickly insert templates into their code during online contests. Additionally, upon initial download, GCC and clangd are automatically installed, so users donâ€™t need to worry about configuring GCC paths.
